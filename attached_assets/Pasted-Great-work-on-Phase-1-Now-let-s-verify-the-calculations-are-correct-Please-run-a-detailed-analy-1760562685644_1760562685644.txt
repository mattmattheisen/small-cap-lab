Great work on Phase 1! Now let's verify the calculations are correct.

Please run a detailed analysis on these 3 stocks and show me the FULL breakdown:

TEST STOCKS:
1. AEIS (my current holding)
2. SOFI (showed 0.0% Kelly before)
3. ARRY (if available, otherwise pick another small cap)

FOR EACH STOCK, SHOW ME:

STOCK: [SYMBOL] at $[PRICE]
Date Range: [START] to [END]

HMM REGIME ANALYSIS:
- Current Regime: [Bull/Sideways/Bear]
- Regime Confidence: [XX]%
- Regime Status: [STABLE/UNCERTAIN/TRANSITIONING]
- Status Reason: [Why it got this status]

KELLY CALCULATION BREAKDOWN:
- Base Kelly: 0.15
- × Confidence Multiplier: 0.15 × [confidence/100] = [result]
- × Volatility Adjustment: [result] × min(1.0, 0.05/[atr_pct]) = [result]
- Full Kelly (capped at 0.25): [result]
- × Half Kelly Slider (0.5): [result]
- Applied Kelly Fraction: [XX]%

TRANSACTION COST BREAKDOWN:
- Daily ATR: $[X.XX] ([X.XX]% of price)
- Estimated Spread (from High-Low): [XX] bps ([X.XX]%)
- Market Impact (position/volume): [XX] bps ([X.XX]%)
- Slippage (fixed): 5 bps (0.05%)
- One-Way Cost: [XX] bps ([X.XX]%)
- Round-Trip Cost: [XX] bps ([X.XX]%)

EDGE ANALYSIS:
- Gross Edge (from HMM): +[X.XX]%
- Signal Decay (5 days): +[X.XX]% → +[X.XX]%
- Transaction Costs: -[X.XX]%
- Net Edge: +[X.XX]% or -[X.XX]%

REGIME TRANSITION:
- Status: [STABLE/UNCERTAIN/TRANSITIONING]
- Risk Multiplier: [1.0/0.75/0.5]
- Regime History: [last 10 periods if available]

FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
- Tradeable? [✅ YES / ❌ NO - Skip (negative net edge)]
- Applied Kelly: [XX]%
- Position Size (on $40,000 portfolio): $[X,XXX]
- Risk Budget: $[X,XXX]
- Expected Return (net): +[X.XX]%

Please run this analysis for all 3 stocks and show me the full output.
This will help me verify the math is working correctly before we proceed to Phase 2.

## 🎯 What We're Looking For

When Replit responds, I'll help you verify:

### ✅ **Things That Should Be TRUE:**
1. **SOFI should show 0.0% Kelly** (or very low) because net edge is negative
2. **Transaction costs should be 1-3%** for small caps (0.5-1.5% round-trip)
3. **Net edge should be LESS than gross edge** (costs reduce it)
4. **Transitioning stocks should have 0.5x multiplier** applied
5. **ATR% should be 2-6%** for typical small caps
6. **Full Kelly should never exceed 0.25** (hard cap)

### ❌ **Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Transaction costs > 5% (way too high)
- Net edge > gross edge (costs should reduce, not increase!)
- Full Kelly > 0.25 (should be capped)
- All stocks showing same Kelly % (should vary)
- ATR = 0% (calculation error)

## 📊 What Happens Next

**After you paste Replit's detailed analysis here:**

1. **I'll review the math** and confirm it's correct
2. **If correct:** "Great! Proceed to Phase 2 (Excel UI redesign)"
3. **If bugs:** "The transaction cost formula looks wrong, here's why..."

**Then and only then** will we touch the UI.

## 💡 Why This Verification Step Matters

**Scenario 1 - Math is Right:**
```
You: "Numbers look good!"
Me: "Perfect, let's make it pretty (Phase 2)"
[2-3 more days and you're done]
```

**Scenario 2 - Math is Wrong:**
```
You: "Net edge is higher than gross edge?"
Me: "Ah, the formula is backwards. Fix: line 47..."
Replit: [fixes in 10 minutes]
[Then proceed to Phase 2]
