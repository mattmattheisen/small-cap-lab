## Tab 1: HMM Trading Signals

### What It Does
This tool uses a Hidden Markov Model (a type of AI) to detect which "market regime" a stock is currently in, then combines that with candlestick pattern recognition to give you enhanced trading signals.

### How to Use It

1. **Enter a Stock Symbol**
   - Type the ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT) in the text box
   - The system will fetch real-time data from Yahoo Finance

2. **Select Your Analysis Period**
   - Use the date pickers to choose your start and end dates
   - Recommended: At least 3-6 months of data for reliable results
   - More data = better pattern recognition

3. **Click "Analyze"**

### Understanding Your Results

#### Trading Signal Box
You'll see one of these signals at the top:

- **üü¢ STRONG_BUY** - Both the AI model and candlestick patterns agree it's a good time to buy
  - Strength rating shows confidence (1-10 scale)
  - Higher numbers = stronger signal

- **üî¥ STRONG_SELL** - Both indicators agree it's time to sell
  - Pay attention to the strength rating

- **‚ö™ HOLD (Conflict)** - The AI and patterns disagree
  - This means wait for clearer signals
  - It's safer to hold than to trade on conflicting signals

- **üü° BUY (Cautious)** - Only the AI suggests buying
  - Lower confidence, no pattern confirmation

- **üü† SELL (Cautious)** - Only the AI suggests selling
  - Lower confidence, no pattern confirmation

#### What the Reasoning Tells You
Below the signal, you'll see explanations like:
- "HMM Bull regime confirmed by bullish candlestick pattern" = Strong agreement
- "Sideways market detected" = Market is flat, unclear direction
- "Pattern conflict with regime" = Mixed signals, be cautious

#### Market Regime Analysis
The platform identifies three market conditions:

1. **Bull Market** üêÇ
   - Prices are generally rising
   - Good time to look for buying opportunities
   - Average returns shown in green

2. **Sideways Market** ‚ÜîÔ∏è
   - Market is flat or choppy
   - No clear trend
   - Be cautious with new positions

3. **Bear Market** üêª
   - Prices are generally falling
   - Consider selling or waiting
   - Average returns shown in red

#### Candlestick Pattern Analysis
This section shows you:

- **Current Pattern**: What pattern the stock just formed
  - üü¢ Green = Bullish (upward) pattern
  - üî¥ Red = Bearish (downward) pattern
  
- **Direction**: Whether the pattern suggests up (+1) or down (-1)

- **30-Day Pattern History**: How often each pattern appeared recently
  - Bullish Engulfing: Strong reversal pattern indicating upward move
  - Morning Star: Bullish reversal after downtrend
  - Hammer: Potential bottom/reversal signal
  - Bearish Engulfing: Strong reversal pattern indicating downward move
  - Evening Star: Bearish reversal after uptrend

#### Signal Strength Breakdown
Shows you how confident the system is:
- **HMM Confidence**: How certain the AI is about the market regime (0-100%)
- **Pattern Signal**: What the candlestick analysis says
- **Combined Strength**: Overall confidence rating (1-10)

Higher confidence + higher strength = more reliable signal

#### Charts You'll See

1. **Price Chart with Regime Colors**
   - Green zones = Bull market periods
   - Yellow zones = Sideways market
   - Red zones = Bear market periods
   - Shows you visually when market conditions change

2. **Regime State Timeline**
   - Color-coded bars showing market regime over time
   - Helps you see regime stability

3. **Feature Importance**
   - Shows which indicators matter most for predictions
   - Technical detail for advanced users

#### Kelly Position Sizing Summary

At the bottom of the HMM results, you'll see a **Kelly Position Sizing Summary** card with:

- **Win Probability**: Combined probability of winning based on HMM regimes
- **Full Kelly**: Optimal position size according to Kelly Criterion (%)
- **Half Kelly**: Conservative position size (50% of Full Kelly) - **RECOMMENDED**
- **Risk Level**: Visual indicator with emoji
  - üü¢ Conservative (0-25%): Safe position sizing
  - üü° Moderate (25-50%): Balanced approach - **OPTIMAL ZONE**
  - üü† Aggressive (50-75%): Higher risk
  - üî¥ Danger (75-100%): Very aggressive - **AVOID**

üí° **Quick Tip**: This is a preview based on $100k portfolio and 5% stop loss. Visit the Kelly Position Sizing tab to customize for your actual portfolio.

### Pro Tips for HMM Signals

‚úÖ **Best Practices:**
- Look for STRONG_BUY or STRONG_SELL with strength 7+ for highest confidence
- Only trade Bull regimes with 75%+ confidence for conservative approach
- Use HOLD signals as warnings to stay out of the market
- Check the pattern history - frequently appearing patterns are more reliable
- Always reference the Kelly summary for position sizing guidance

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cautions:**
- No system is perfect - always manage your risk
- Low confidence signals (below 60%) should be treated carefully
- Sideways markets are unpredictable - smaller positions recommended
- Always use stop losses to protect your capital
- Never risk more than the Kelly calculator recommends

---

## Tab 2: Kelly Position Sizing

### What Is Kelly Criterion?

The Kelly Criterion is a mathematical formula that tells you the **optimal size** for each trade based on your edge (advantage) in the market. Unlike fixed position sizing (e.g., always risking 2%), Kelly dynamically adjusts based on:

- **Your probability of winning** (calculated from HMM regime analysis)
- **Your win/loss ratio** (how much you make when right vs. lose when wrong)

**Why Kelly Is Better Than Fixed Position Sizing:**
- Maximizes long-term growth while managing risk
- Automatically sizes down when edge is small
- Sizes up when you have a strong advantage
- Prevents over-leveraging on bad trades
- Mathematically optimal for wealth growth

### Why Half Kelly (0.5x) Is Recommended

**Full Kelly** can be too aggressive, especially for volatile small-cap stocks. Here's why we recommend **Half Kelly**:

- **Reduces volatility**: Half the position size = smoother equity curve
- **Lower drawdowns**: Protects against estimation errors in probabilities
- **Safer for small caps**: Small-cap stocks are inherently more volatile
- **Still optimal**: Half Kelly still grows wealth faster than fixed sizing
- **Forgives mistakes**: If your win probability estimate is off, Half Kelly cushions the impact

### How to Use It

1. **Stock Symbol**
   - Auto-populated if you ran HMM analysis first
   - Or manually enter any ticker symbol
   - Data fetches automatically from Yahoo Finance

2. **Set Your Parameters:**

   - **Portfolio Value**: Your total trading capital
     - Be honest - only use actual trading capital
     - Don't include long-term holdings
   
   - **Stop Loss %**: Where you'll exit if trade goes against you
     - Recommended: 3-5% for moderate risk
     - Conservative: 5-7%
     - Aggressive: 2-3% (requires tighter monitoring)
   
   - **Fractional Kelly Multiplier**:
     - **0.25x (Quarter Kelly)**: Ultra-conservative, beginner-friendly
     - **0.50x (Half Kelly)**: **RECOMMENDED** - Best balance
     - **0.75x (Three-Quarter Kelly)**: Aggressive, experienced traders only
     - **1.0x (Full Kelly)**: **NEVER USE ON SMALL CAPS** - Too risky

3. **Click "Calculate Kelly Position"**

### Understanding Your Results

#### Win Probability Calculation
Shows you:
- **Hybrid win probability**: Combines HMM regime analysis with historical win rates
  - Bull regime probability √ó Bull win rate
  - Sideways regime probability √ó Sideways win rate
  - = Your overall chance of winning this trade

#### Win/Loss Ratio Breakdown
- **Average Win**: Mean return when trades are profitable (from Bull regime positive days)
- **Average Loss**: Mean loss when trades fail (from Bear regime negative days)
- **Win/Loss Ratio**: How many dollars you make per dollar risked

#### Kelly Fraction
- **Full Kelly %**: Mathematically optimal position size
  - Formula: f* = (p √ó b - q) / b
  - p = win probability, q = loss probability, b = win/loss ratio

#### Applied Kelly %
- Your **actual position size** after applying fractional multiplier
- This is the percentage of your portfolio to risk on this trade

#### The Speedometer Gauge

The gauge visually shows your position size with color-coded risk zones:

- **üü¢ Green Zone (0-25%)**: Conservative
  - Safe for beginners
  - Lower returns but minimal risk
  - Good for uncertain markets

- **üü° Yellow Zone (25-50%)**: Moderate/Optimal
  - **IDEAL ZONE FOR MOST TRADERS**
  - Balances growth and safety
  - Half Kelly typically lands here

- **üü† Orange Zone (50-75%)**: Aggressive
  - Higher risk of significant drawdowns
  - Only for experienced traders
  - Requires excellent risk management

- **üî¥ Red Zone (75-100%)**: Very Aggressive/Danger
  - **AVOID THIS ZONE**
  - Can lead to devastating losses
  - Even professionals don't use this
  - Indicates over-leveraging

#### Position Sizing Recommendations

You'll see three key numbers:

1. **Position Size ($)**: Dollar amount to invest
   - Based on your portfolio value √ó Applied Kelly %
   
2. **Number of Shares**: How many shares to buy
   - Position size √∑ current stock price
   
3. **Stop Loss Price**: Exact price to exit if trade fails
   - Protects your capital automatically

### Critical Risk Warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Kelly Criterion Assumes Your Probabilities Are Accurate:**
- If your win rate estimate is wrong, Kelly can over-leverage
- This is why we use fractional Kelly (0.5x) - forgives estimation errors
- Always conservative with probability estimates

**Small Caps Are Volatile:**
- **NEVER use Full Kelly (1.0x) on small-cap stocks**
- Minimum recommended: Half Kelly (0.5x)
- Safer: Quarter Kelly (0.25x) for volatile small caps
- Small caps can gap down 20%+ overnight - be prepared

**Kelly Optimizes Long-Term Growth, Not Short-Term Safety:**
- Kelly maximizes wealth over many trades
- Single trade can still lose money
- You need proper bankroll to survive drawdowns
- Don't use Kelly if you can't afford volatility

**Always Use Stop-Losses:**
- Kelly calculation assumes you'll cut losses at specified %
- **MUST execute stop loss** at the percentage you entered
- No stop loss = Kelly formula breaks down
- Use guaranteed stops for overnight holdings

### Pro Tips for Different Strategies

#### üõ°Ô∏è Conservative Small Cap Strategy

**Best for: Beginners, risk-averse traders, volatile markets**

- Use **Quarter Kelly (0.25x)**
- Only trade in **Bull regimes with 75%+ confidence**
- Require **STRONG_BUY signals** (strength 8+)
- Set **stop-losses at 5-7%**
- Maximum 3-5 positions at once
- **Expected**: Lower returns, much lower risk

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Moderate Strategy (RECOMMENDED)

**Best for: Most traders, balanced approach**

- Use **Half Kelly (0.5x)** ‚úÖ
- Trade **Bull regimes with 65%+ confidence**
- Require signal **strength 7+**

### Kelly Warning System

The platform will show warnings when:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Position Exceeds 20% of Portfolio**
- Consider reducing to avoid concentration risk
- Even if Kelly says higher, diversification matters
- Suggests splitting into multiple positions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Full Kelly Detected (1.0x multiplier)**
- Switch to Half Kelly (0.5x) for lower volatility
- Full Kelly too aggressive for small caps
- Reduce multiplier immediately

‚ö†Ô∏è **Low Edge Detected (Kelly < 5%)**
- Skip this trade - edge is too small
- Transaction costs may eat profits
- Wait for better opportunities
- Focus on higher-conviction setups

‚ö†Ô∏è **High Volatility Stock**
- Use Quarter Kelly (0.25x) instead
- Volatility can cause large swings
- Smaller position = better sleep
- Consider options strategies instead

### What It Does
Helps you discover promising small-cap stocks (smaller companies) based on fundamental analysis criteria like growth, profitability, and valuation.

### How to Use It

1. **Set Your Screening Criteria:**

   **Growth Filters:**
   - **Revenue Growth Rate**: Minimum yearly revenue increase
     - Recommended: 15-20% for growth stocks

     - Lower = safer, but may limit growth
     - Recommended: Below 1.0 for conservative, below 2.0 for aggressive
   
   - **Max PEG Ratio**: Price/Earnings to Growth ratio
     - Below 1.0 = potentially undervalued
     - Below 2.0 = fairly valued
     - Above 2.0 = potentially overvalued

   **Liquidity:**
   - **Min Average Volume**: Daily trading volume
     - Higher volume = easier to buy/sell
     - Recommended: At least 100,000 for liquidity

2. **Market Cap Range:**

## General Tips for Using the Platform

### Recommended Trading Workflow

Follow this systematic approach for best results:

**Step 1: Run Screener ‚Üí Find Candidates**
- Use Tab 4 (Small Cap Screener) to find promising stocks
- Look for strong growth metrics and reasonable valuations
- Filter for adequate liquidity (volume)
- Create a watchlist of 5-10 candidates

**Step 2: HMM Analysis ‚Üí Check Regime + See Kelly Preview**
- Run Tab 1 (HMM Trading Signals) on each candidate
- Look for Bull regimes with 65%+ confidence
- Check candlestick pattern confirmation (STRONG_BUY signals)
- Review the Kelly Position Sizing Summary at bottom
- Eliminate stocks with HOLD or weak signals

**Step 3: Kelly Tab ‚Üí Fine-Tune Position Size**
- Switch to Tab 2 (Kelly Position Sizing)
- Stock symbol auto-populates from HMM
- Enter your actual portfolio value
- Set appropriate stop-loss percentage (3-7%)
- Choose fractional Kelly multiplier:
  - Beginners: 0.25x (Quarter Kelly)
  - Most traders: 0.5x (Half Kelly) ‚úÖ
  - Experienced: 0.75x max
- Review gauge - stay in Green or Yellow zones
- Note exact position size and stop-loss price

**Step 4: Execute with Proper Stop-Loss**
- Enter trade at calculated position size
- **IMMEDIATELY set stop-loss** at specified price
- Use guaranteed/hard stops for overnight positions
- Never move stop-loss lower (only higher as price rises)
- Monitor position daily
- Exit at stop-loss if hit - NO EXCEPTIONS

### Risk Management Reminders

- **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**
- **Diversify across multiple stocks** - Don't put all capital in one position
- **Always use stop-loss orders** - Kelly assumes you'll execute stops
- **Never exceed 20% in single position** - Even if Kelly says higher
- **Pay attention to HOLD signals** - Sometimes doing nothing is best
- **Strong signals (8-10 strength) are more reliable** than weak ones (1-5)
- **Use fractional Kelly (0.5x or less)** - Full Kelly is too aggressive
- **Monitor Kelly gauge colors** - Stay in Green/Yellow zones

### When Signals Conflict

If you see:
- **HMM says BUY, but patterns say SELL** ‚Üí System shows HOLD (wait for clarity)
- **High Kelly % but SELL signal** ‚Üí Don't trade - signals must align
- **Low Kelly % but STRONG_BUY** ‚Üí Small edge detected, consider skipping
- **Screener finds stock but HMM shows SELL** ‚Üí Wait for regime change
- **Kelly in Red zone** ‚Üí Reduce position size immediately
- **Multiple warnings in Kelly tab** ‚Üí Skip this trade entirely
